                            Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in
                            1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world,
                            by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New,
                            innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java,
                            as well.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you have
                            written code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it is very easy to move the code to
                            a mobile device. When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems
                            (later acquired by Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
                            It's also important to understand that Java is much different from JavaScript. Javascript
                            does not need to be compiled, while Java code does need to be compiled. Also, Javascript
                            only runs on web browsers while Java can be run anywhere.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            New and improved software development tools are coming to market at a remarkable pace,
                            displacing incumbent products once thought to be indispensable. In light of this continual
                            turnover, Java’s longevity is impressive; more than two decades after its creation, Java is
                            still the most popular language for application software development—developers continue to
                            choose it over languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Swift, C++, and others. As a result,
                            Java remains an important requirement for competing in the job market.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Java is a technology consisting of both a programming language and a software platform. To
                            create an application using Java, you need to download the Java Development Kit (JDK), which
                            is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You write the program in the Java programming
                            language, then a compiler turns the program into Java bytecode—the instruction set for the
                            Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is a part of the Java runtime environment (JRE). Java
                            bytecode runs without modification on any system that supports JVMs, allowing your Java code
                            to be run anywhere.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Java software platform consists of the JVM, the Java API, and a complete development
                            environment. The JVM parses and runs (interprets) the Java bytecode. The Java API consists
                            of an extensive set of libraries including basic objects, networking and security functions;
                            Extensible Markup Language (XML) generation; and web services. Taken together, the Java
                            language and the Java software platform create a powerful, proven technology for enterprise
                            software development.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In particular, Java technology is an ideal framework for developing web applications, the
                            foundation for a digital business in any industry. Java application servers are web
                            containers for Java components, XML, and web services, which interact with databases and
                            provide dynamic web content. Java application servers form a stable deployment environment
                            for enterprise applications with capabilities such as transaction management, security,
                            clustering, performance, availability, connectivity, and scalability.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Java also wins points with strategic planners for its ability to adapt to new use cases. For
                            example, Java is widely considered to be an ideal platform for the Internet of Things (IoT).
                            The typical IoT application interconnects a large number of disparate devices, a task that
                            is greatly simplified by the fact that billions of devices run Java. Furthermore, Java’s
                            extensive ecosystem of developers is constantly developing and sharing new libraries with
                            functionality specifically targeted at IoT application development.
